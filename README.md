## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to determine the sentiment or emotion behind a piece of text. In this beginner-friendly project, we analyze product reviews from Flipkart to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can help businesses understand customer opinions and improve their products and services.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is a collection of product reviews from Flipkart. Each review contains textual content and a sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral).

## Steps Involved

1. Getting the Data: Collect the product reviews from Flipkart. Use the 'Flipkart Reviews.csv' file uploaded to the repository.
2. Cleaning the Data: Preprocess the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and standardizing the text.
3. Transforming Flipkart Reviews into PieChart: Visualize the distribution of sentiments in the reviews using pie charts.
4. Using NLTK to Unmask Customer Emotions: Utilize NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to process the textual data.
5. Turning Customer Emotions into Numbers: Convert the processed text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

## Model

The model used for sentiment analysis is a logistic regression classifier. The text data is preprocessed using tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
